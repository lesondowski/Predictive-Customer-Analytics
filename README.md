# Predictive Customer Analytics

**End of Year Sale Campaign**

- Launch a new offer - Gold Membership, 20% off all purchases, only $499, while other days are $999. This offer is only available to existing customers and is currently planning a call campaign for them.

**Reduce Costs in Project Execution**

- Management wants to reduce the cost of the campaign by creating a predictive model that will classify customers who are likely to purchase the offer.
